                    painted in<time datetime="1884"> 1884</time>, is Georges Seurat's most famous work. It is a leading example of pointillist technique, executed on a large canvas. Seurat's composition includes a number of Parisians at a park on the banks of the River Seine.</p>
                <p>The painting was first exhibited at the eighth (and last) Impressionist exhibition in<time datetime="1886-05"> May 1886</time>, then in<time datetime="1886-08"> August 1886</time>, dominating the second Salon of the Société des Artistes Indépendants, of which Seurat had been a founder in<time datetime="1884"> 1884 </time>. Seurat was extremely disciplined, always serious, and private to the point of secretiveness—for the most part, steering his own steady course. As a painter, he wanted to make a difference in the history of art and with La Grand Jatte, succeeded.</p>

                    is a<time datetime="1942"> 1942</time> oil on canvas painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people in a downtown diner late at night as viewed through the diner's large glass window. Also portrayed are the exteriors of the urban structures across the street from the diner.</p>
                

                <p>It has been described as Hopper's best-known work and is one of the most recognizable paintings in American art. Within months of its completion, it was sold to the Art Institute of Chicago on<time datetime="1914-12-13"> May 13, 1942</time> for $3,000.</p>

                <p>The scene was supposedly inspired by a diner (since demolished) in Greenwich Village, Hopper's neighborhood in Manhattan. Hopper himself said the painting <q>was suggested by a restaurant on Greenwich Avenue where two streets meet.</q> Additionally, he noted that <q>I simplified the scene a great deal and made the restaurant bigger.</q></p>
